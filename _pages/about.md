Hi! I am Robert Chen, an undergraduate student in Honor Mathemetics and Computer Science at NYU, College of Art & Science.

I'm interested in probability theory and mathematical physics. I'm currently working with Dr. Tyler Chen on randomized algorthim for density matrix, and also working with Dr. Daniel Stein and Dr. Chuck Newman on spin glasses.
