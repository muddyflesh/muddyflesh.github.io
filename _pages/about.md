Hi! I am Ruixin(Robert) Chen, a 4th-year student in Honor Mathemetics and Computer Science at NYU, College of Art & Science.

I'm interested in probability theory and its applications to statistical mechanics and randomized algorithms. I'm currently working with Prof. [Tyler Chen](https://chen.pw/) on randomized algorthim for hierarchical low rank matrices, and also working with Profs. [Daniel Stein](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/daniel-l-stein.html), [Charles Newman](https://math.nyu.edu/faculty/newman/), and [Jon Machta](https://people.umass.edu/machta/) on zero-temperature glauber dynamics on hypercubes. Previously, I've worked with Prof. Tyler Chen on randomized partial trace algorithm, and with Prof. [Nina Holden](https://cims.nyu.edu/~holden/) on Schramm-Lowener Evolution.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball and guitar. My favorite music genre is indie pop/R&B.
