Hi! I am Robert Chen, an undergraduate student in Honor Mathemetics and Computer Science at NYU, College of Art & Science.

I'm interested in probability theory and mathematical physics. I'm currently working with Professor [Tyler Chen](https://chen.pw/) on randomized algorthim for density matrix, and also working with Professor [Daniel Stein](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/daniel-l-stein.html) and Professor [Charles Newman](https://math.nyu.edu/faculty/newman/) on spin glasses.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball, and I am a huge fan of GSW (Golden State Warriors). I also play guitar, and I enjoy listening to Chinese folk, rock and hip-pop.
